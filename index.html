  <h1>Privacy Policy for ScrubDex</h1>

  <p class="meta"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 12, 2026</p>

  <p>
    ScrubDex is a surgical case logging and journaling application designed for 
    personal record-keeping, self-audit, and workflow organization. This Privacy 
    Policy explains how information is handled when using the app.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    ScrubDex does <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or store user-entered 
    case data on developer-controlled servers.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>No personal information (such as name, email address, or phone number) is collected by the developer</li>
    <li>No analytics services are integrated</li>
    <li>No crash reporting services are integrated</li>
    <li>No advertising SDKs or tracking technologies are used</li>
    <li>No data is sold, rented, profiled, or monetized</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. User-Entered Data</h2>
  <p>
    User-entered data may include case logs, diagnoses, procedures, patient-related notes, tasks, and images.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>All such data is stored locally on the user’s device</li>
    <li>It is not transmitted to the developer</li>
    <li>It is not stored on ScrubDex-controlled servers</li>
    <li>The developer does not access or process this data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Permissions and Device Features</h2>

  <h3>Biometric Authentication</h3>
  <p>
    ScrubDex may use device-level biometric authentication (such as fingerprint 
    or facial recognition) to secure access to the app.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Biometric authentication is processed entirely by the device’s operating system</li>
    <li>ScrubDex does not collect, store, or access biometric data</li>
    <li>The app receives only confirmation of successful authentication</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Camera Access</h3>
  <p>
    ScrubDex may request access to the device camera to allow users to capture 
    and attach images to case entries.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Captured images are stored locally on the device</li>
    <li>Images are not transmitted to the developer</li>
    <li>Users may revoke camera permission at any time in device settings</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Storage Access</h3>
  <p>
    Storage access may be required to save exported files or create local backups.
  </p>

  <h3>Notification Permission</h3>
  <p>
    Notification permission may be requested to enable reminders and scheduled alerts.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Processing</h2>

  <h3>Local Storage</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>All user-entered data remains stored locally on the device</li>
    <li>ScrubDex does not operate backend servers for case storage</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Optional Google Drive Backup</h3>
  <p>
    ScrubDex provides an optional, user-initiated Google Drive backup feature.
  </p>

    <li>Backup is manually initiated by the user</li>
    <li>Data is stored within the user’s own Google Drive account</li>
    <li>Data transfer occurs directly between the app and Google Drive</li>
    <li>ScrubDex does not store backup copies on developer servers</li>
    <li>The developer does not access Google Drive backup data</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Use of Google Drive is governed by Google’s own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Export</h2>
  <p>
    ScrubDex allows users to export data in <strong>PDF, JSON, or CSV</strong> format.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Export files are generated entirely on the device</li>
    <li>Exported files are saved or shared at the user’s discretion</li>
    <li>Exported data is not transmitted to the developer</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Users are solely responsible for ensuring exported files are handled in compliance 
    with applicable institutional policies and patient confidentiality obligations.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    ScrubDex does <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share user-entered data with third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    If Google Drive backup is enabled, data is shared only with Google Drive under 
    the user’s control and subject to Google’s privacy terms.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    ScrubDex is <strong>not a medical device</strong> and does not provide medical advice,
    diagnosis, or treatment recommendations.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The app is intended solely for logging and organizational purposes</li>
    <li>It does not replace professional medical judgment or institutional records</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Users are solely responsible for how recorded information is used.
  </p>

  <h2>8. User Control and Data Deletion</h2>

    <li>Entries may be added, edited, or deleted within the app</li>
    <li>Google Drive backups may be enabled, disabled, or deleted by the user</li>
    <li>Uninstalling the app permanently removes locally stored data</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
